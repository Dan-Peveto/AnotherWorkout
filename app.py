Well come to Bastard Training Workout App:

This is a coding project to produce a functioning app that will allow the user to plan future workouts, record past workouts, and analyze GAINZ
This coding project has four phases

Phase 1 (Initial Code): The object of phase one is to create a fully functioning console app that allows users to:
    - Create user profile
    - Create customized workout plan
    - Record workouts in real time
    - Pull history of workouts
 
    TODO: 
        
        ** Create Exercise Save Logic **
        Create Mass Save Class
        Populate Exercise Class with Mass Save Class 
    TODO:
        Create Workout Class

    TODO: 
        Create Program Class

Phase 2 (App Refinement): The object of phase two is to refine the initial app to allow user the following:
    - Choose premade workouts
    - Customize premade workouts
    
Phase 3 (Limited Deployement): The object of phase three is to generate UI using Django. After this phase the user will be able to:
    - Log into the online application
